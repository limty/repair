          <li>Our Repair Coaches will assess the condition of your item. If it’s within their repair capability, they will direct you to the appropriate station after making sure you have read and signed off on the Repair Kopitiam house rules.
          </li>

          You will be guided by our Repair Coaches to first diagnose the fault with the item, explore methods of rectification and then start repairing it.

          While our Repair Coaches have undergone some training before each session, it is quite possible that the repair job may not work out due unavailability of certain tools or spare parts.</li>
